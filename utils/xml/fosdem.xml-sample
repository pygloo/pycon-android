    <abstract>FOSDEM Opening Talk</abstract>
    <description>FOSDEM was started under the name OSDEM (Open Source Developers of Europe Meeting) by Raphael Bauduin. Raphael says that, since he felt he lacked the brains to properly contribute to the open source community, he wanted to contribute by launching a European event in Brussels. It was an immediate success, with speakers coming from all over.

The FOSDEM conference is coming to its tenth birthday. We will quickly go over the history and present.</description>

    <description>There's a lot of evil things on the Internet if you know where to look
for them. Phishing websites collect banking credentials; mule
recruitment websites entice people into money laundering; fake escrow
sites defraud the winners of online auctions; fake banks hold the cash
for fake African dictators; and there are even Ponzi scheme websites
where (almost) everyone knows that they're a scam.  This talk will show
you live examples of these sites, explain how they work, and tell you
what we currently know about the criminals who operate them.</description>

    <title>What is my system doing - Full System Observability with SystemTap</title>
    <subtitle/>
    <track>Monitoring</track>
    <type>Podium</type>
    <language>English</language>
    <abstract>SystemTap an application that observes your system on multiple levels, from kernel, libraries, applications, java to database transactions. SystemTap is a new player in the monitoring world!:t</abstract>
    <description>Ever wondered what your system is really doing? Even if your whole system consists of Free Software you might still be scratching your head about what is really going on. Reading all the sources or staring at a core dump after the fact only gets you that far. You have to observe your system while it is running. Luckily the last few years there has been lots of improvements in GNU/Linux around how to monitor, trace, profile and debug your system. Kernel ftrace, pref, tracepoints, better debuginfo, application and library probe points, tapsets and compatibility with dtrace. Systemtap can take advantage of it all and provides a powerful way to get full system observability.

Want to dive deep into applications, java processes or the linux kernel without needing to stop or interrupt anything? SystemTap is the tool of choice for complex tasks that may require live analysis, programmable on-line response, and whole-system symbolic access. SystemTap can also handle simple tracing jobs. Learn how to setup SystemTap, what ready to run scripts there are, and how to tailor your probes to specific applications or kernel usage patterns.

SystemTap can observe on multiple levels, from kernel, libraries, applications, java to database transactions. To help users to get a better view what an application is doing you can add tapsets and static markers. And such markers can be made compatible with dtrace (to make your solaris hacker friends happy). There are already lots of packages that provide such high level observability, Postgresql, Java hotspot, Xorg, Python, Firefox, etc. Learn how to rapid prototype observability of your application through tapsets with function and statement probes (on any existing binary) and how to add high-level (zero-overhead) markers to your package sources that tell users about everything important, passes, transactions, service starting/stopping, etc.</description>

    <type>Podium</type>
    <language>English</language>
    <abstract>During the talk Bernard will give an overview of Ganglia's strong points and it's technical architecture.</abstract>
    <description>This talk will start off with a brief overview of the early beginnings of the project and how it has become the de facto standard for monitoring clusters and grids. The talk will then dive into the technical architecture of the system, discuss scalability issues, challenges ahead in adapting the software for cloud environments and other future developments. If you work with a lot of computers, then this talk is for you.

Ganglia is a scalable system performance monitoring software started by Matt Massie in 1999 while he was at the University of California, Berkeley working on the Millennium Project.  Since the inception of the project, it has seen 40+ releases and 299,208 total downloads recorded by SourceForge.net. Ganglia is simple to install and use and is available on most UNIX platforms. 30+ system metrics such as CPU load, memory usage, network traffic are collected by default and can be further extended via a command line metric reporting tool or pluggable modules written in C or Python. Ganglia is being used extensively all over the world by organizations large and small.</description>

    <title>Starting the sysadmin tools renaissance: Flapjack + cucumber-nagios</title>
    <subtitle/>
    <track>Monitoring</track>
    <type>Podium</type>
    <language>English</language>
    <abstract>Monitoring software is ripe for a renaissance. Now is the time to for building new tools and rethinking our problems. 
Leading the charge are two projects: cucumber-nagios, and Flapjack.</abstract>
    <description>A systems administrator's role in today's technology landscape has never been so important. It's our responsibility to manage provisioning and maintenance of massive infrastructures, to anticipate ahead of time when capacity must be grown or shrunk, and increasingly, to make sure our applications scale. 

While developer tools have improved tremendously, we sysadmins are still living in the dark ages, other than a few shining beacons of hope such as Puppet. We're still trying to make Nagios scale. We're still writing the same old monitoring checks. Getting statistics out of our applications is tedious and difficult, but increasingly important to scaling. 

cucumber-nagios lets you describe how a website should work in natural language, and outputs whether it does in the Nagios plugin format. It includes a standard library of website interactions, so you don't have to rewrite the same Nagios checks over and over. 

cucumber-nagios can also be used to check SSH logins, filesystem interactions, mail delivery, and Asterisk dialplans. By lowering the barrier of entry to writing fully featured checks, there's no reason not to start testing all of your infrastructure. But as you start adding more checks to your monitoring system you're going to notice slowdowns and reliability problems - enter Flapjack

Flapjack is a scalable and distributed monitoring system. It natively talks the Nagios plugin format (so you can use all your existing Nagios checks), and can easily be scaled from 1 server to 1000. 

Flapjack breaks the monitoring lifecycle into several distinct chunks: workers that execute checks, notifiers that notify when checks fail, and an admin interface to manage checks and events. 

By breaking the monitoring lifecycle up, it becomes incredibly easy to scale your monitoring system with your infrastructure. Need to monitor more servers? Just add another server to the pool of workers. Need to take down your workers for maintenance? Just spin up another pool, and turn off the old one.</description>

    <title>The Nmap scripting engine</title>
    <subtitle/>
    <track>Security</track>
    <type>Podium</type>
    <language>English</language>
    <abstract>The Nmap Scripting Engine extends the results of an Nmap port scan. It
combines the Lua programming language, a library of network functions,
and the results provided by other parts of Nmap to give more information
about network hosts and their open ports.</abstract>
    <description>There are standard scripts that grab SSH host keys or SSL certificates, discover the remote date
and time, check for weak passwords and unpatched vulnerabilites, and
much more.

The talk will explain how the scripting engine fits in with Nmap's other
functions, the structure of a script, and how to modify a script or
write your own. We'll see how the scripting engine can benefit casual
users, researchers, and security auditors. Finally there will be a brief
overview of what's new in Nmap and its associated tools for the benefit
of casual users.</description>

    <abstract>Expect an overview of the basic architecture as well as practical examples of how to customize OSSEC to manage logging from your infrastructure and applications.</abstract>
    <description>Log management, Intrusion detection/prevention and event correlation is a challenge we have been facing for decades.  Most of us have been able to ignore it but with developments in regulatory compliance (PCI-DSS, HIPAA, SOX, ISO27K, ...) companies are required to investigate solutions.  
In this talk we will firstly touch upon the
problems that will be faced during such a project and how log management will look in the future (new standards are on their way).   After this boring introduction to
the magical world that is log management and intrusion detection we will delve into the solution that is presented with OSSEC.  While labeled as a Host-based Intrusion
Detection System (HIDS), OSSEC provides you with a complete arsenal of functionalities that allow you to build a log management solution which will translate
the most cryptic log message into a clear and actionable alert.  Expect an overview of the basic architecture as well as practical examples of how to customize OSSEC to manage logging from your infrastructure and applications.</description>

    <track>Lightning Talks</track>
    <type>Lightning-Talk</type>
    <language>English</language>
    <abstract>The main goal is to buffer the time between the opening of the room, and the first real lightning talk.

If time permits, there will be a lightning talk about the lightning talks: with statistics about the proposals and acceptances, and the story of how these lightning talks are organized. Extra time can be filled with questions related to the organisation of the FOSDEM conference at large.</abstract>
    <description>The FOSDEM Lightning Talks are organized by Mattias 'Tias' Guns since 2007. The lightning talks allow projects that do not fit in a developer room to present themselves to the large developer audience at FOSDEM.

Lightning Talks can be described as the 15 minutes of fame for all free or open source projects. During exactly 15 minutes, one person gets to present the project or any aspect of it. All the lightning talks happen in a large room that can host up to 300 people.</description>

    <type>Lightning-Talk</type>
    <language>English</language>
    <abstract>The talk gives a brief general view on the project's political and technical background in Germany's largest Municipality, shows the goals already achieved like the complete migration to OpenOffice.org and the city-wide use of the Open Document Format (ODF) and explains the steps for the next two years, the large-scale migration to the linux client.</abstract>
    <description>Munich's LiMux project aims at the use of free software and open standards on most of the 14,000 PCs of the Municipality's administration. Challenges are the integration of the Debian GNU/Linux client, the availability of (proprietary) business applications for this linux client and the migration to OpenOffice.org.</description>

    <title>CiviCRM: Common goals of FOSS and Not For Profit Organisations</title>
    <subtitle/>

    <type>Lightning-Talk</type>
    <language>English</language>
    <abstract>CiviCRM support the work of NGOs on advocacy and better communication with their members and the general public. It allows to handle newsletters, receive donations, manage the membership and help organising events, all sharing the same contact database, and offering a 360 view of their contacts.

But beside helping the NGOs to work better with an efficient software, there is also a common set of values about sharing, openness, transparency and freedom that are should be better promoted by FOSS promoters and better understood by NGOs.

I will present how CiviCRM can help the civil society, and how to highlight these shared values while introducing FOSS to the civil society.

All that in 15 minutes.</abstract>
    <description>CiviCRM is an open source and freely downloadable constituent relationship management solution. It iss web-based, open source, internationalized, and designed specifically to meet the needs of advocacy, non-profit and non-governmental groups. Integration with both Drupal and Joomla! content management systems gives you the tools to connect, communicate and activate your supporters and constituents.</description>

    <subtitle/>
    <track>Lightning Talks</track>
    <type>Lightning-Talk</type>
    <language>English</language>
    <abstract>Originally, I wanted to do a talk which actually demonstrates the automated setup of a RHEL 4 or 5, Debian 4 or 5 or NetBSD 4 or 5 system live, and using the resulting system to deploy new systems. However, I think 15 minutes would be a little tight for that. I want to talk about:

1: 5 minutes introduction: why openpcf
2: 5 minutes internals: how it works
3: 5 minutes results: what you can do with it</abstract>
    <description>OpenPCF (which stands for Open Provisioning and Control Framework) is an open-source, automated system configuration tool. It can generate configurations for any service that runs on a posix-like platform. Services like DHCP, DNS, HTTP, LDAP and many more are supported.

OpenPCF aims to automate the often-times manual labour of configuring services on a computer system you've just setup. The ultimate goal is a system that sets up all services needed within a datacenter resulting in a computer system that can deploy (through tftp, dhcp, pxe, http, nfs, cifs) various operating systems.</description>

    <title>tinc: the difficulties of a peer-to-peer VPN on the hostile Internet</title>
    <subtitle/>
    <track>Lightning Talks</track>
    <type>Lightning-Talk</type>
    <language>English</language>
    <abstract>Rather than configuring tunnels, a tinc VPN is more or less specified by its endpoints. The tinc daemons will automatically set up tunnels in order to create a full mesh network. The problem in today's Internet is that many users are trapped behind NAT, and ISPs are known to drop ICMP packets, IP fragments, and/or UDP packets, making reliable connections between peers difficult.  Another problem is how to manage authentication and authorization in a fully decentralized, but user-friendly way.  In this talk I will look at solutions already implemented in tinc and other VPN software, and I look at future work to solve the remaining problems.</abstract>
    <description>tinc is a Virtual Private Network (VPN) daemon that automatically tries to create a full mesh network between peers. It can route IPv4 and IPv6 packets, or switch any type of Ethernet packet to create a virtual LAN. It can tunnel over IPv4 and IPv6, and runs on Linux, *BSD, Solaris, MacOS/X and Windows.</description>

    <title>Beernet: Building peer-to-peer systems with transactional replicated storage</title>
    <subtitle/>
    <track>Lightning Talks</track>
    <type>Lightning-Talk</type>
    <language>English</language>
    <abstract>We will very briefly introduce Beernet's architecture describing the peer-to-peer network topology, the distributed hash table, and the transactional layer for replicated storage (called Trappist). We will also describe Beernet's API to create peers, exchange information between them, and to store and retrieve data from them. We will finally describe some applications built on top of Beernet, such as a small wiki, a collaborative drawing tool, and a web-base recommendation system.</abstract>
    <description>Beernet is a library to build distributed systems as peer-to-peer networks. It provides replicated storage with distributed transactions, which are highly robust because they do not rely on a centralized point of control. Beernet can be used to develop synchronous and asynchronous collaborative applications. We have used it to build a decentralized wiki, a collaborative drawing application with gPhone clients, and a web-base recommendation system.

Beernet stands for pbeer-to-pbeer network, where words peer and beer are mixed to emphasise the fact that this is peer-to-peer built on top of a relaxed-ring topology (beers are a known mean to achieve relaxation). The relaxed-ring provides a distributed hash table (DHT) with no central point of control and without relying on transitive connectivity between peers.</description>

    <title>SIP Communicator: Skype-like conf calls with SIP Communicator</title>
    <subtitle/>
    <track>Lightning Talks</track>
    <type>Lightning-Talk</type>
    <language>English</language>
    <abstract>Most of us have probably seen at one point or another someone using Skype for a conference call. We all know how well it works and how good it looks. In the SIP Communicator project, we have recently implemented support for a similar feature. In addition to mixing audio streams from all participants and then sending it back to them, we also distribute member information and audio level analysis to all members. We even support distributed conferences where mixing resources are provided by several different clients, and yet, all members get to the same view of the call and who's in it. 

We believe that the various difficulties that we've faced along the way would be interesting to people working in the field of real-time communication and would therefore love to present them. The talk would be technical but would not require substantial technical background. In other words, if you are interested in VoIP then chances are you would like to see it.</abstract>
    <description>SIP Communicator is an open source (LGPL) audio/video Internet phone and instant messenger. It includes support for advanced telephony features such as conference calls, call transfer, and video calls with SIP. Jabber calls with jingle are also on the way. IM wise the application supports some of the most popular protocols such as SIP, Jabber, AIM/ICQ, MSN, Yahoo! Messenger and others.</description>

    <subtitle/>
    <track>Lightning Talks</track>
    <type>Lightning-Talk</type>
    <language>English</language>
    <abstract>This talk will be about a file synchronizer designed for the normal user. I will tell you how it and works and how you can use it to synchronize your music collection or set it up for Roaming Home Directories.</abstract>
    <description>csync is a lightweight utility to synchronize files between two directories on a system or between multiple systems.

It synchronizes bidirectionally and allows the user to keep two copies of files and directories in sync. csync uses widely adopted protocols, such as smb or sftp, so that there is no need for a server component. It is a user-level program which means you don't need to be a superuser or administrator.

Together with a Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM), the intent is to provide Roaming Home Directories for Linux.</description>

    <subtitle/>
    <track>Lightning Talks</track>
    <type>Lightning-Talk</type>
    <language>English</language>
    <abstract>This talk would be about explaining what the shadowcircle project is: 

- why was it created. 
- what is the philosophy behind this project.
- what are you concretely able to do with the integrated tools.
- why is it better than other similar solution (backtrack)
- Final words : we need contributors to side projects in order to replace some non FOS software.

a Demo would also be performed : a vulnerabilities check on remote host ( implies 2 pc, provided by the speaker ) + exploit with specific payload.</abstract>
    <description>shadowcircle is a free GNU/Linux Live CD distribution which was specially crafted for penetration testers. 

Forked from backtrack, this distribution aims to:

- Remove any peace of non free software that was initially the backtrack packages base, and replace them by FOS equivalents.
- Bring more documentation about the integrated tools. 
- Integrate cutting-edge security tools that are not yet available in similar distributions.</description>

    <title>SyncEvolution: From the SyncML Protocol to Free and Open Implementations</title>
    <subtitle/>
    <track>Lightning Talks</track>
    <type>Lightning-Talk</type>
    <language>English</language>
    <abstract>Data synchronization is still mostly a missing piece in the free desktop
puzzle: solutions that are reliable and ready for the mythical Average
User just aren't available. This talk presents the SyncML protocol,
introduces the Synthesis SyncML engine (developed since 2000, open sourced
2009) and outlines how SyncEvolution is used as the synchronization
solution in Moblin, GNOME and other Linux desktop systems - stay tuned for
more news about this.

SyncEvolution is meant to be a cross-platform solution, therefore this
talk would be suitable for the cross-desktop developer room.

Direct synchronization with other mobile devices is the main new feature
in the upcoming Moblin 1.0 release. It will be covered in this talk for
the first time.</abstract>
    <description>SyncEvolution is a tool that synchronizes personal information management (PIM) data like contacts, calenders, tasks, and memos using the SyncML information synchronization standard. SyncEvolution compiled for GNOME's Evolution supports all of these data items. Compiled for Nokia 770/800/810 Internet Tablets, Mac OS X and the iPhone (only 0.7), it supports synchronizing the system address book. The command-line tool 'syncevolution' (compiled separately for each of these platforms) executes the synchronization. In addition, there is the GTK "sync-UI". The external Genesis is a graphical frontend for SyncEvolution written in PyGTK. The GUIs make SyncEvolution accessible without having to use a command line and provides graphical feedback of transaction results.

SyncEvolution was written to have a small, reliable solution for Evolution PIM data synchronization without reinventing the wheel. SyncML is the established industry standard and Funambol has kindly provided their source code under the GPL, so there was already an existing code base for client and server development. During SyncEvolution's development special attention was paid to automated testing and coverage of corner cases of the SyncML, vCard and iCalendar standards to ensure that no data gets lost or mangled.

The focus right now is to deliver the best possible SyncML client for Moblin and Linux. With the switch to the Synthesis SyncML Engine it will be easier to also implement a server mode and direct device-to-device synchronization - this is already working in the 1.0 alpha release.</description>

    <abstract>The talk introduces the Android intents mechanism. It is an essential part of the design of the Android mobile operating
system that allows reuse and stimulates interoperability of apps.</abstract>
    <description>From an open source perspective it also liberates the core functionality of the system, by making it possible to replace the native system applications. Extremely powerful if harnessed correctly, new Android developers ought to discover it early on, and hopefully embrace this unique feature en masse. For advanced aficionados, this talk will also briefly touch the related subjects of security and dependency management, an idea currently being discussed within OpenIntents.</description>

    <abstract>Basing an embedded device on FOSS brings many advantages, not the least of which is complete control over the software stack and free reuse of existing high quality solutions. However, it also means having to deal with large amounts of code, mainly coming from external parties. Dealing with this can be a challenge for small embedded teams, used to smaller stacks developed in-house.</abstract>

    <type>Podium</type>
    <language>English</language>
    <abstract>Flukso is an open source (HW &amp; SW) web-based community metering application. Flukso allows you to accurately monitor and reduce your household electricity consumption via [http://www.flukso.net its website] and API.</abstract>
    <description>This talk will focus on the embedded development of our 801.11g wireless sensor node called the Fluksometer. Fluksometer development went through several iterations. It evolved from a hacked-up Arduino - WRT54G prototype, via an Arduino Wee - Fonera in alpha to the custom sensor board - Abocom WAP2102 which we are now using in our beta trial.

This hybrid approach, connecting a custom sensor board to an off-the-shelf wifi router via UART, allowed us to develop a generic sensing platform that can be used for monitoring almost any physical unit, provided a suitable sensor can be found. We currently focus on measuring household electricity consumption and, in the near-future, photo-voltaic production. We will present our sensor node's hardware (AVR and Atheros AR1217) and software (based on AVR-libc and OpenWRT 8.09) architecture and discuss its (dis)advantages and a lessons learned.</description>

    <language>English</language>
    <abstract>Iris is a new capability-based microkernel operating system.</abstract>
    <description>Being a microkernel system, it is easy to work on things which on other systems need kernel programming (and root priviledges).  Being a capability-based system, it allows transparent virtualization of everything.  This leads to improved security to such a degree, that the user can really trust the computer.  A capability-based system also allows easy monitoring of communication.  Another nice feature is that the user can swap target devices under a running program. I know we are in time to be very picky in the schedule, but should be cool if the speeches are made in different days</description>

    <title>Hermes Message Dispatching</title>
    <subtitle/>
    <track>Distributions</track>
    <type>Podium</type>
    <language>English</language>
    <abstract>Hermes is a message digesting and distribution system which is aimed to give back control to the user. Many already existing systems produce a lot of information for users, mostly by flooding with email. That was a very practical and quick solution in the past, but nowadays there are more elegant methods of notifying.</abstract>
    <description>Hermes lets the user control, which information approaches him and how. It collects information from connected sources, manages user subscriptions to the various notification types and provides the user with a selection of the messages he wants to get, as mails, feeds or jabber messages and more.

This talk is an introduction to Hermes and the way the openSUSE project uses it for all kinds of notifications about the distribution.</description>

    <abstract>[http://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://en.opensuse.org/images/b/b0/FOSDEM-2009-YaST.pdf At FOSDEM 2009, we presented an overview of YaST] related new developments and where we were heading.
In this talk we will review the progress made and present the features/ideas that have high priority for the next openSUSE release and areas where we are doing research that will eventually be features in future versions.</abstract>
    <description>YaST is a powerful installation and system management tool for Linux environments. It is an open source project sponsored and actively developed by Novell, and part of openSUSE Linux since its inception. It has evolved a lot over time, providing single source modules that run in different user interfaces (QT4, GTK2, ncurses and web), as well as scripting language bindings.</description>

    <abstract>MirrorBrain is a Download Redirector and Metalink Generator</abstract>
    <description>MirrorBrain is an open source framework to run a content delivery network using mirror servers. It solves a challenge that many popular open source projects face - a flood of download requests, often magnitudes more than a single site could practically handle.

A central (and probably the most obvious) part is a "download redirector" which automatically redirects requests from web browsers or download programs to a mirror server near them.

Choosing a suitable mirror for a users request is the key, and MirrorBrain uses geolocation and global routing data to make a sensible choice, and achieve load-balancing for the mirrors at the same time. The used algorithm is both sophisticated and easy to control and tune. In addition, MirrorBrain monitors mirrors, scans them for files, generates mirror lists, and more.</description>

    <type>Meeting</type>
    <language>English</language>
    <abstract>Seeing that all distributions face the problem of maintaining their infrastructure (server landscape, keeping the services running, managing downtimes), this round table is an open discussion forum for infrastructure maintainers from all distributions and maybe other large projects which are running their own infrastructure.</abstract>
    <description>After a short overview about the infrastructure issues a linux distribution can have, these issues can be discussed between the infrastructure maintainers of different distributions and other interested parties. Besides learning about how other people handle infrastructure issues, this round table should also be a means of getting to know the people behind the infrastructure of other distributions.

All infrastructure personnel attending FOSDEM is invited to join us in this round table.</description>

    <track>Distributions</track>
    <type>Podium</type>
    <language>English</language>
    <abstract>Easy software access should be considered as one of the key success for Linux distributions. One important consideration to ease the access to software is the quality and localization of software descriptions. At the moment each distribution has its own way to manage this using different processes, each one being more or less manual. This also requires a huge effort for localization teams since the amount of text to translate is important.</abstract>
    <description>This session aims to start an effort of investigation on how this work can be mutualized between distributions: avoiding the duplicated work would certainly benefit everybody. This would also enable a focus on providing one user-friendly solution for localization teams to work on the translations. As a first step, the current processes in distributions have to be evaluated, in order to develop a good plan on how to best achieve a cross-distribution effort.</description>

    <language>English</language>
    <abstract>This session is not a talk, but an interactive session. The goal of this session is to have the downstream and upstream people working on GNOME meet, joke, fight, laugh, cry and dance together. And after that, an open discussion will take place about all the topics that we feel we should discuss.</abstract>
    <description>Potential topics include:
* what GNOME is not doing right for downstream, and how we could change this
* what GNOME is doing right compared to other projects, so we know this should not be changed ;-)
* forwarding downstream patches and bugs
* forwarding feedback from distribution users
* communicating important bugfixes to downstream
* how GNOME 3 will affect packagers</description>

    <language>English</language>
    <abstract>The co-operation between Nokia and non-Nokia members of the Maemo community has evolved radically over the lifetime of the project. Since its inception in 2008, the Maemo Community Council has become a key element of how the Maemo community co-operates with Nokia in setting priorities for the project. The council is elected by the Maemo Community, and represents the community's interests to Nokia, and has a large say in the priorities of the maemo.org staff, a group of people paid by Nokia to work on the Maemo project.</abstract>
    <description>This presentation will present the history and achievement of the council, with a view to identifying lessons which other vendor-led communities might be able to learn from the governance structure which has been put in place.</description>

    <abstract>GNOME Color Manager: exploring the user experience and integration points for a 100% color managed desktop</abstract>
    <description>GNOME Color Manager is a new project intending to make color management in the GNOME desktop "just work". In this presentation I will quickly introduce why color management is required, and also the problems introducing a color management workflow. We will compare and contrast the frameworks commonly used in OSX and Windows 7. By discussing the integration points, we will be talking to application developers and platform maintainers in order to shape the future development of GNOME Color Manager. We will also spend some time exploring the intricacies of a color management framework best suitable for GNOME, and how GNOME Color Manager can start to provide this functionality.

There will be time left for questions and discussion. It is expected the audience will be moderately technically skilled, and possess a basic understanding of color management.</description>

    <abstract>OCRFeeder is a document layout analysis and optical character recognition system that I wrote for my Master's Thesis project.</abstract>
    <description>Like it says on its website, given the images it will automatically outline its contents, distinguish between what's graphics and text and perform OCR over the latter. It generates multiple formats being its main one ODT.

I think this is currently the most complete and user friendly OCR application for GNU/Linux out there and, of course, I wrote it to be used mainly with GNOME, featuring a GUI written in PyGTK and respecting, as far as I could, the GNOME User Interface Guidelines.

I would like to present how the application works on the inside, for example the page segmentation algorithm I created for it, etc. I think this would be interest for the GNOME community and general attendants of the GNOME Dev room at FOSDEM.</description>

    <abstract>JAIN SLEE is a specification (JSR 240) of a real-time and event-based platform in JAVA. It can be seen as the equivalent of the JEE but for real-time and oriented to Telecommunication, especially NgIN and IMS.</abstract>
    <description>However, it could be used for any other JAVA applications requiring performance. In this talk we will introduce the JAIN SLEE throug the Mobicents project, the first certified-JAINSLEE 1.1 and open source application server from RedHat.

The presentation will cover:
* The JAIN SLEE component model and the event-driven programming
* The mobicents JAIN SLEE 1.2 features and the introduction to EclipSLEE the Service Creation Environment on Eclipse
* IMS example: we will show how we can implement a SIP registrar with JAIN SLEE. We will also show how a JAIN SLEE AS might be integrated in an IMS infrastructure.</description>

    <title>Tips and Tricks for Extension Developer</title>
    <subtitle/>

    <type>Podium</type>
    <language>English</language>
    <abstract>The session will give an overview about the Extension infrastructure and will give tips and hints what's most important to integrate well in OpenOffice.org and to provide a more professional extension. Extensions provide often the necessary connector from OpenOffice.org to other software systems and the better they are integrated the better is the overall user experience and the interoperability.</abstract>
    <description>OpenOffice.org Extensions provide a very good mechanism to extend OpenOffice.org with new and often specialized new functions. The extension infra structure gets better and better and an extension developer should make use of all the available feature to integrate best in the office. The session will give an overview about the Extension infrastructure and will give tips and hints what's most important to integrate well in OpenOffice.org and to provide a more professional extension. Often extensions are the beginning of more advanced development tasks that will go deeper in the core code of OpenOffice.org whereas extensions use API's only. The advantage of extensions is that you can work on a standalone mini project that uses official API's only and that you can learn the basics and secrets of OpenOffice.org step by step. But extensions can not solve all problems and often additional changes in the core or even new API's are necessary to solve a specific task. But as mentioned before extensions provide a smooth way to get started and to dive deeper and deeper into the large project code base over time. OpenOffice.org is a very huge project and the start to develop with and for OpenOffice.org is not easy and the hype factor is also not the highest one. But it must be something behind this project that big companies hire special people to work on campaigns against OpenOffice.org and open source in general. Is it still David versus Goliath or has the situation changed a little bit? Who knows but you can be part of the huge and worldwide community and can start to develop with and for OpenOffice.org.</description>

    <subtitle/>
    <track>OpenOffice.org</track>
    <type>Podium</type>
    <language>English</language>
    <abstract>The main goal of the framework project is to provide low-level functions (like loading/storing documents, generic UI, OLE, filter management) to the application modules. As the generic OpenOffice.org UI is mainly based on framework code many aspects of the Project Renaissance must be implement there. This presentation wants to provide an overview about our latest plans to provide new and powerful docking window functions.</abstract>
    <description>The presentation is split up into four different parts:
# The current state of docking window design
# The new docking window design
# How can extensions profit from the new design
# Future outlook</description>

    <abstract>OpenOffice.org is too fat and too weird to let you simply apply your standard unit-testing-approach to writing correct code. Over the years, this has lead to the creation of a number of mechanisms within the OOo code base with which OOo developers can test the code they write and compile.</abstract>
    <description>Some of the mechanisms are, erm, creative, some are trivial. But what all the mechanisms have in common is that they all are brittle and all start to fail, in one way or another, sooner or later. Time to clean up. This talk will discuss where we intend to go, and probably tell a couple of anecdotes about where we came from.</description>

    <abstract>ODFDOM is the name of the free OpenDocument framework, which was recently published in version 0.75 to support ODF 1.2.</abstract>
    <description>Its overall purpose is to provide the ODF developer community a lightweight programming API in order to easily access and manipulate ODF documents. With its version 0.75, ODFDOM supports all ODF 1.2 elements and attributes, generated from the OpenDocument RelaxNG schema directly into the Java source code. The upcoming presentation will give an overview over the architecture, design ideas and in addition deliver insights about the roadmap and upcoming features.</description>

    <title>Beyond UNIQUE: Exclusion constraints in PostgreSQL 9.0</title>
    <subtitle/>
    <track>PostgreSQL</track>
    <type>Podium</type>
    <language>English</language>
    <abstract>PostgreSQL 9.0 introduces the feature Exclusion Constraints, and this talk will present this feature and how to use it to solve this type of problem with a declarative constraint - while maintaining performance and concurrency in the system.</abstract>
    <description>A core feature of a relational database is being able to define constraints on the data, and have the database enforce those constraints. Today, there exists only one kind of constraint that will look at a combination of more than one row in a table - the UNIQUE constraint, often used as a tables PRIMARY KEY. This constraint makes sure no two rows have the same combination of values in the specified columns. But many datamodels contain completely different constraints, such as requiring non-overlapping ranges. For example, the requirement that a resource such as a conference room is not double booked.</description>

    <abstract>Elephants and Other Wild Animals: PostgreSQL at the Heart of the Ticketing Point of Sale in the Basel Zoo</abstract>
    <description>For 134 years the Basel Zoo, one of the most renowned and beautiful zoos in Europe, has sold entrance ticket by hand. A simple roll of paper tickets and manual book keeping where all that was there. Being a legal incorporated, law forced them to introduce an electronic point of sale system. First of January 2009, the system went into production and, unlike in other Zoos, worked without any problems right from the start. It is now in production for a year and has proven extremely stable and efficient.

The PostgreSQL database is at the heart of the point of sale application and in this presentation Marc Balmer will show how PostgreSQL helped to create an enterprise grade application database which is accessed by different client applications in a distributed network, including low-bandwidth network links. The overall application architecture will be discussed and how PL/PGSQL helped to keep the business logic in the database itself, leveraging client complexity. Details will be given about the Motif based POS application, written in pure C and extended in Lua, as well as the backoffice which is web based and implemented in C and Lua. The presentation is aimed at programmers that want to include PostgreSQL in their application portfolio as well as decision makers that have to decide upon a strategic database platform for their products.</description>

    <abstract>A modern PC is quite different from the 1980s original, and while the BIOS still lingers after 30 years it must now solve many tricky problems.</abstract>
    <description>When the original PC with it's pre-ISA expansion bus was powered on, it was almost immediately ready to run an application. Today's PC can have several multicore CPUs interconnected by HyperTransport, Front Side Bus or QuickPath, DDR3 RAM on each CPU, and a large number of buses and peripherals. Many components require increasingly complex initialization to be implemented in software. This talk describes the technical challenges encountered by coreboot developers and their solutions.</description>

    <abstract>Flashrom is the open source utility of choice to identify, read, write, verify and erase flash chips.</abstract>
    <description>It is commonly used to flash BIOSes from under Linux, *BSD, OpenSolaris and Mac OS X, but it also has the ability to reflash graphics cards, SATA controllers, network cards and one game console. A wide variety of external programmers is supported as well, from ultra-cheap homemade setups to high end commercial machines.
Hotflashing and crossflashing complete the feature set.

This talk introduces flashrom, and explains its structure and implementation. Common issues and future directions are explained, and even a demonstration will be given.</description>

    <abstract>Many board makers provide extra write protection for their BIOS chips. The developers at the flashrom project have to devote part of their time on finding out what protection is present and how this can be disabled.</abstract>
    <description>Some of this information comes from the BIOS itself, and the procedures for some common BIOSes, and the tools involved will be introduced in this talk. Part of the time will be spent on digging through an actual BIOS with a crude tool like ndisasm.</description>

    <track>Free Java</track>
    <type>Podium</type>
    <language>English</language>
    <abstract>The purpose of this talk is to introduce Groovy using a practical approach by showing the differences and the improvements that Groovy bring, compared with an older programming language class.

Since groovy is based on the JVM, it is natural to compare it with Java language.</abstract>
    <description>We will start from a couple of java classes and we will rewrite it using Groovy and we will see how Groovy removes the ceremony and give a shorter and more understandable code.

During the talk will be also explained theory concepts around groovy implementations time to time will be faced.
Despite the topic, this talk is open to java and non-java developers.</description>

    <abstract>Introduction and a Getting Started to the wizard4j project.</abstract>
    <description>The wizard4j project defines a flowchart xml language to describe flowcharts in a formal way (so this logic is no longer burried in the rest of the code). Next it provides an engine written in java to 'run' these flowcharts. The target audience for this project are java software developers. Any java application that has some 'flowchart logic' inside (configuration wizards, helpdesk guidelines, surveys, template preprocessing, ...) can benefit from wizard4j, especially when this logic is complex or requires frequent updates.</description>

    <abstract>Java web development is often based on a growing stack of software layers. This increasing complexity is impacting productivity and causing frustration of developers in each step of development, maintenance and deployment. The Play framework aims to bring back the fun with a simpler and cleaner stack, introducing conventions over configuration and encouraging RESTful architectures.</abstract>
    <description>Version 1.0 have been released in October 2009 under the Apache 2 Licence. We will present the framework, explain and demonstrate how it is used to develop web applications, and introduce the vision and roadmap for the next versions.</description>

    <abstract>This talk will start by briefly introducing RepRap - the replicating rapid prototyper.</abstract>
    <description>The talk will then look at how a growth of replicator technology may change economic activity, society, and the nature of wealth.  Material costs for a RepRap are currently about 350 EUR.  That means that RepRap is accessible to small communities in the developing world as well as to individuals in the developed world.  The designs for the RepRap machine are being  is distributed free to everyone using the GPL - so people can copy the machines to their friends without limit.

Finally it will examine replicator technology in the biological context, considering both it and human beings to be collaborating and competing replicators in a Darwinian ecology</description>

    <description>MINIX started in 1987 and led to several offshoots, the best known being Linux. MINIX 3 is the third major version of MINIX and is now focused on very high-reliability and security. When you buy a TV set, you just plug it in and it works perfectly for the next 10 year. We are trying to make operating systems as good as that. The current version of MINIX 3 can detect device driver crashes and some server crashes and automatically replace the failed component without user intervention and without affecting running processes. The talk will discuss these aspects as well as new work.</description>

    <title>Large scale data analysis made easy - Apache Hadoop</title>
    <subtitle/>
    <track>Scalability</track>
    <type>Podium</type>
    <language>English</language>
    <abstract>The goal of Apache Hadoop is to make large scale data analysis easy. Hadoop implements a distributed filesystem based on the dieas behind GFS, the Google File System. With Map/Reduce it provides an easy way to implement parallel algorithms.</abstract>
    <description>Storage has become ever cheaper in recent years. Currently one terabyte of harddisk space costs less than 100 Euros. As a result a growing number of businesses have started collecting and digitizing data: Custumer transaction logs, news articles published over decades, crawls of parts o f the world wide web are only few use cases that produce large amounts of data. But with petabytes of data at your fingertips the question of how to make ad-hoc as well as continuous processing efficient arises.

The goal of Apache Hadoop is to make large scale data analysis easy. Hadoop implements a distributed filesystem based on the dieas behind GFS, the Google File System. With Map/Reduce it provides an easy way to implement parallel algorithms.

After motivating the neeed for a distributed library the talk gives an introduction to Hadoop detailing its strengths and weaknesses. It gives an introduction on how to quickly get your own Map/Reduce jobs up and running. The talk closes with an overview of the Hadoop ecosystem.</description>

    <subtitle/>
    <track>Scalability</track>
    <type>Podium</type>
    <language>English</language>
    <abstract>This talk will give you a better idea of what it takes to scale Facebook.</abstract>
    <description>From the day that Mark Zuckerberg started building Facebook in his Harvard dorm room in 2004 to today, the site has been built on common open source software such as Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP.  Today Facebook reaches over 350 million people per month, is the largest PHP site in the World, and has released major pieces of our infrastructure as open source.

It's not possible to scale a site like Facebook simply by sharding your databases, rather we've developed and contributed to a series of open source infrastructure technologies.  Some of these projects include Cassandra, Hive, Haystack, memcached, and Scribe, where each focuses on solving a specific problem with Thrift allowing them to communicate across languages.  This talk will give you a better idea of what it takes to scale Facebook, a look into the infrastructure we use to do so, and dive into performance work we're focused on in order to scale PHP to over 350 billion page views per month.</description>

    <description>Web developers who want to add charts and graphs to their web sites have three options. 
1. Use server side generated chart images 
2. Use flash 
3. Use canvas + javascript

Option 1 is often the best unless you need some level of interactivity at which point you're stuck with choosing between flash that has problems with focus on linux, and has never been a favourite of FOSS developers, or using canvas + javascript with incomplete support for Internet Explorer through excanvas.  YUI-flot follows option 3. 

YUI-flot came about as an attempt to bring the popular flot plugin for jQuery into the hands of YUI developers, and in this talk, I'll cover a little bit about what you can do with YUI-Flot, and a little more about what I learnt while developing it.</description>

    <description>This presentation takes a look at CouchDB, a distributed, fault-tolerant and schema-free document-oriented database accessible via a RESTful HTTP/JSON API. CouchDB design and replication features solve  the problem of high-traffic websites, distributed peer-to-peer, and offline application, all in the same time. 

The talk will cover the different CouchDB usages and integration in applications and its deployment. It will also present how to build and distribute standalone CouchDB applications on top of CouchDB using its  REST API. CouchDB applications can run on users desktop an be replicated using a P2P system. Data could also be available offline.</description>

    <language>English</language>
    <abstract>Process checkpoint consists in saving the state of a running process, so that the process can be restarted at any time later. Uses include fault tolerance, job suspend that frees memory resources, process live-migration across physical machines. Checkpoint services may checkpoint only single processes as well as full operating systems with processes, file systems, socket states, etc. This talk will present Kerrighed's application checkpoint/restart and show its advantages in flexibility over other checkpoint services.</abstract>
    <description>Kerrighed is a Single System Image operating system for clusters. It offers the view of a unique SMP machine on top of a cluster of standard PCs.

Kerrighed is implemented as an extension to the Linux operating system (a set of modules and a patch to the kernel). Current development version is based on Linux 2.6.30.

Main available features are:
* Cluster wide process management with customizable load balancing over the cluster (through process migration and remote forking)
* Cluster wide shared memory
* Application checkpointing
* Node addition/removal</description>

    <title>Cloudlets: universal server images for the cloud</title>
    <subtitle/>
    <track>Lightning Talks</track>
    <type>Lightning-Talk</type>
    <language>English</language>
    <abstract>In this talk we will discuss the issue of server images, and how it affects inter-cloud portability. We will describe our vision for a universal format which can be shared and improved as easily as a Git repository, and how we're implementing it with cloudlets.</abstract>
    <description>Cloudlets are universal server images for the cloud. They're lightweight, version-controlled, and you can export them to any bootable format known to man: Xen, KVM, Amazon EC2, or just a plain bootable CD. They can be shared and distributed with the semantics of tools such as Git and Mercurial.

Our goal is to build the foundations for truly cloud-independent infrastructures. Our roadmap includes:

  * Multi-image stacks
  * Auto-scaling
  * Automated integration tests
  * In-place image editing
  * Integration with existing VM generation and configuration management tools</description>

    <title>Wt::Dbo: a C++ ORM (Object Relational Mapping) library</title>
    <subtitle/>
    <track>Lightning Talks</track>
    <type>Lightning-Talk</type>
    <language>English</language>
    <abstract>The talk introduces Wt::Dbo. It will be compared to existing ORM and database solutions for C++ and other programming languages. Based on simple examples, you will learn how you can use Wt::Dbo to manipulate objects that are stored in a database from within C++.</abstract>
    <description>Wt::Dbo is a brand new C++ ORM layer. Similar to Hibernate for Java and ActiveRecords for Ruby, Wt::Dbo offers a convenient way to interact with objects which are serialized in a database.

Although the lack of introspection in C++ seems to be problematic to write a decent ORM in C++, Wt::Dbo demonstrates that appropriate use of the C++ template system offers a perfect alternative.

Currently, Wt:dbo contains the following functionality:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automatic schema creation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mapping of 1-N and M-N relations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lazy loading of objects and collections&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uses prepared statements throughout&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basic query support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automatic dirty checking and database synchronization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Built-in optimistic locking (using a version field)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transactional integrity, even when a transaction fails: dirty objects remain dirty and may later be saved in a new transaction, or may be reverted to their persisted state (unlike Hibernate where you are forced to discard the whole session)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transaction write-behind for changes, with support for manual flushing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forces use of surrogate keys&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does not depend on Wt (can be used independently)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple backend system: at the moment only SQLite3. We are looking at how we can perhaps can leverage SOCI if it makes its way into Boost.&lt;/li&gt;

If you don't know them, they will hurt you. No matter how expert you are, there are holes in your knowledge, and when things go wrong you usually blame what you know the least. So the culprit could be that database, the regular expression engine, the XML parser, the thread engine. What if the problem is between the chair and the keyboard instead? This talk will give you some general insight on the art of software development, encouraging users to rant less and improve their own practice.</abstract>

    <title>Kaizendo.org: Customizing schoolbooks the free software way</title>
    <subtitle/>
    <track>Lightning Talks</track>
    <type>Lightning-Talk</type>
    <language>English</language>
    <abstract>Imagine having a schoolbook where a pupil and her teacher can choose the depth of topic, clarity of text, pedagogical method, amount and difficulty of homework - as needed and necessary.

This talk introduces the Kaizendo.org project where this is the ambition - to create a tool which makes authoring of custom books not only possible but as easy as posting a comment on a forum.</abstract>
    <description>Take your regular old-fashioned linear schoolbook and imagine each chapter having alternative versions specifically tailored for the reader.



You'll have book that works both for pupils that read slow and pupils that zip through the text faster than their classmates. Add alternatives for the teacher (supporting different pedagogical methods, teaching styles), the school (variations on which chapters should be in-depth or which topics should be prioritized) and the parents (a topic summary to read before helping with homework.)



And you'll have a book that can only be made using free software development methods.



Kaizendo.org - from Kaizen-do, "the way of incremental improvement" - is a project for making these books possible. We have just started, and we need people who would like to help! :)</description>

    <subtitle/>
    <track>Lightning Talks</track>
    <type>Lightning-Talk</type>
    <language>English</language>
    <abstract>CESLA has launched  "The wiki for open technologies " project. This project is addressed to the open source community and to the Internet world on the whole to allow collaboration between different groups and organizations. 

The talk will cover the following topics:

* Thewiki4opentech policy and goals
* What is different in the technological wiki?
* How to contribute. 
* Benefits for contributors and for the open source community.</abstract>
    <description>The Wiki for Open Technologies is an Internet site where you can find technical information and discuss about projects and ideas. Also you can edit almost all of the pages on this site and place new ones. 
This wiki is a project managed by CESLA, the Free Software &amp; Open Content Association of Aragon, Spain. With this project CESLA intends to create a technological content reference for everybody. 

Thewiki4opentech team is working to provide the open source community with a useful tool. This project is based on Mediawiki and implements some improvements to syndicate content with the same or compatible license. A vertical search engine, included in the wiki, allows searching in the most prestigious open source pages. Thewiki4opentech own content, the syndicated content from other wikis and the search engine  cover most of the open source technical information so the community will be able to find the most relevant  information and the main trends related to a topic

Projects are saved as a whole and topics are sorted in tags and not just as an article, this wiki is a site where  projects are well documented and classified. All improvements around projects follow the objective of empowering open source initiatives and innovation in the open source community</description>

    <title>QuBit: Introducing Quantum Superpositions</title>
    <subtitle/>
    <track>Lightning Talks</track>
    <type>Lightning-Talk</type>
    <language>English</language>
    <abstract>The only talk that can use the phrase 'quantum mechanics' and not sound pretentious! It covers the principles of programming with variables that can hold multiple values at the same time - i.e. quantum superpositions, and how (and why) it's impossible to know which of those values will be returned if you query the variable. It also details the library itself, and how to use it. (uses the C++ Qubit library, based on Damien Conway's Perl module)</abstract>
    <description>QuBit is a library to support Quantum Superpositions in C++. This allows each CQuBit variable to hold a number of different values at the same time. Normal mathematical operations can be performed on a QuBit, but they affect every value in the QuBit, at the same time. Binary Operations on two QuBits cause a result based on every possible outcome.</description>

    <language>English</language>
    <abstract>When I started to build Padre, the Perl IDE in June 2008 almost everyone in the Perl community thought it is a waste of effort in a failed project to create something that no one wants.



After 1.5 year, over 50 releases, more than 10,000 commits by many contributors we can say Padre is on its way to become the de facto editor for Perl 5 and Perl 6.



It would have not been possible without the growing support from the Perl community and without the reuse of over 200 CPAN modules written by other people.



In this talk I'll talk about Padre and how we managed to build the team. How we got included in all the major Linux distributions and what else have we done to build the product?</abstract>

    <title>Coccinelle: Finding bugs in open source systems code</title>
    <subtitle/>
    <track>Lightning Talks</track>
    <type>Lightning-Talk</type>
    <language>English</language>
    <abstract>Bugs are pervasive in code. And when one finds one bug there are often
others of the same type lurking in other parts of the code base. The
difficulty then is how to find them efficiently within thousands or
millions of lines of code.

At the University of Copenhagen, in collaboration with researchers in Paris
and Aalborg, we have been developing the Coccinelle program matching and
transformation engine (http://coccinelle.lip6.fr). Coccinelle provides a
language, SmPL (semantic patch language), for writing complex code patterns
that may perform simple searching or that can be annotated with
transformation information. A novelty of Coccinelle is that these patterns
look very similar to ordinary source code. Nevertheless, SmPL patterns can
be made generic using pattern variables, and are matched according to the
semantics of the source code rather than the line-by-line syntax, and hence
we have given them the name semantic patches.

In this talk, we will introduce Coccinelle and the SmPL language, and then
illustrate its use with examples based on bugs that we have found and fixed
in Linux kernel code. In particular, we will focus on how the source-code
like language makes it easy to customize the bug finding process to very
specific problems and to fine-tune semantic patches to reduce the number of
false positives, which plague automated bug finding tools.  To date, over
400 patches derived from the use of Coccinelle have been accepted into the
Linux kernel source tree.</abstract>

In developing Coccinelle, we have particularly targeted Linux kernel code.
Nevertheless, Coccinelle has been applied in the context of other open source

from the use of Coccinelle have been accepted into the Linux kernel source tree.</description>

    <abstract>This talk will introduce UmlCanvas in all its appearances: a Javascript library, a hosting service and soon a collaborative platform enabling "Social Modeling". We will illustrate what is possible with the current release and what we're up to in the near future. The talk will give the audience enough information for them to understand the UmlCanvas concepts, go to the UmlCanvas website and start creating online embeddable diagrams right away.</abstract>
    <description>UmlCanvas is a Javascript library that turns an HTML5 Canvas element into a dynamic and interactive UML diagram editor and presentation tool ... on every HTML page, on and off the web. 
UmlCanvas also offers a hosting service that puts your diagrams online. Design your diagram once, include it in many HTML-based formats: your own pages, your blog, feed readers and even Google Wave. 
Integrating CASE tools and hosted UmlCanvas, creates a collaborative platform that enable modelers to step out of the closed environment of their desktops and extend their modeling into the social web.</description>

    <type>Podium</type>
    <language>English</language>
    <abstract>When launched, Google created a central point of distributing applications for the Android platform: the Android Market.This approach, although being an undefined standard for most of the major mobile families - Apple as AppStore for their iphone - has limitations, specially in user freedom and flexibility for the development.

Aptoide tries to create a way of sharing applications for Android in a way that the users are in control of what they distribute, how they distribute and what they want to see shared.</abstract>
    <description>We will present the Aptoide concept and compare this to philosophies - central point vs distributed repositories - commenting on each pros and cons, and trying to merged them together.

In the end of the day, this talk proposes to show Android developers a new way of put their applications available which is an alternative of closed and inflexible Google's Android market.</description>

    <abstract>There are lots of cross build systems out there these days. While all of these projects have their own focus, concept and design, there are a lot of problems most of us know very well, for example cross build problems,developing patches in an upstream-acceptable way etc.</abstract>
    <description>In this workshop, all participating build system groups will get the opportunity to present three slides and five minutes, in order to outline:
* short project description
* plans for the future
* ideas to collaborate

After that, we'll collect and discuss those ideas in order to create benefit for both, the involved projects and the whole open-source eco-system.

Any project interested in participation, please write us a mail to crossdev@send-patches.org, in order to organize the presentations.</description>

    <title>Media Controller, harnessing the full power of tomorrow's video devices</title>
    <subtitle/>
    <track>Embedded</track>
    <type>Podium</type>
    <language>English</language>
    <abstract>Back when the first version of the Video 4 Linux (V4L) API was written, video acquisition and output devices available to Linux users ands developers only offered basic functions. With the introduction of hardware compression, V4L showed its limits and the new V4L2 API saw the light of the day in the 2.5.x kernels. Video hardware available today once again pushes the Linux video API to its limits, and there's no doubt that tomorrow's devices will offer even more complex features.</abstract>
    <description>Several V4L developers go together during the Linux Plumbers Conference 2009 to discuss a possible future extension to the V4L subsystem called the Media Controller.

Targeted at both embedded and desktop hardware, the Media Controller will let userspace applications access media hardware internals to discover and control device internals. This talk will introduce the Media Controller concept and present the current state of the draft implementation.</description>

    <abstract>The microprocessor OMAP 3430 contains a dual-core architecture consisting on an ARM Cortex-A8 (General-Purpose Processor) and a DSP C64x (as an Image-Video-Audio Accelerator).

The dspbridge is a kernel driver for the OMAP3 architecture. It provides a interface to control and communicate with the DSP, enabling parallel processing in embedded devices.</abstract>
    <description>This talk will be about how to build a system with the dspbridge driver and how to use it for multimedia applications.</description>

    <title>Scripting Mobile Devices with AmbientTalk</title>
    <subtitle/>
    <track>Embedded</track>
    <type>Podium</type>
    <language>English</language>
    <abstract>This talk is about programming mobile handheld devices with a scripting language called AmbientTalk.</abstract>
    <description>This language has been designed with the goal of easily prototyping applications that run on mobile devices interacting via a wireless network. 

Programming such applications traditionally involves interacting with low-level APIs in order to perform basic tasks like service discovery and communicating with remote services. We introduce the AmbientTalk scripting language, its implementation on top of the Java Micro edition platform (J2ME).

AmbientTalk is an experimental object-oriented distributed programming language developed at the Software Languages Lab at
the Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Belgium. The language is primarily targeted at writing programs deployed in mobile ad hoc networks.

AmbientTalk is meant to serve as an experimentation platform to experiment with new language features or programming abstractions to facilitate the construction of software that has to run in highly volatile networks exhibiting intermittent connectivity and little infrastructure.</description>

    <type>Podium</type>
    <language>English</language>
    <abstract>Most people use open source software day by day. A fact that most of them do not know: Often, this free software is being developed, documented, marketed and improved by volunteers in their free time. Many open source projects work on fostering the idea of free software and open content, and a lot of users benefit from their efforts. Other than with proprietary software, users can get in direct touch with the communities via blogs, IRC channels, mailing lists or forums.</abstract>
    <description>Despite the modern way of communicating, personal contact still is the best way to get to know each other. Meeting the people behind the names in reality is a great experience, and helps users of finding their way into open source communites to engage themselves. Therefore, Mozilla and OpenOffice.org jointly organize the so-called "Open-Source-Treffen" ("Open Source Meetings") to help open source projects in meeting their end-users and vice versa. Members of the community can get in touch with their users to gather valuable feedback, and open source adopters meet other supporters from their area.
In the German city of Munich, the "Open-Source-Treffen" have been taking place regularly, and the idea is to spread the word for other areas, engaging community members to set up more meetings. Carsten Book of Mozilla and Florian Effenberger of OpenOffice.org, founders of the "Open-Source-Treffen", introduce their vision and tell about the previous experiences. Audience for this talk are open source communities wishing to set up their own meetings as well as interested users who love to learn more about the idea.</description>

    <abstract>According to a report generated in 2007 less than 10% of the CPAN packages are redistributed by Debian and Fedora and much less by the other distributions.</abstract>
    <description>This is frustrating to the end user as they need to install many other packages directly from CPAN. Because they already have to install from CPAN they don't care asking the distributors to include those packages nor do they come and help packaging. Hence there are few packages....

In this session we will try to break the vicious cycle of the chicken and the egg and find an improvement to the situation.</description>

    <abstract>For a casual user, editing configuration files in /etc in an intimidating task. Manually managing configuration upgrade is even worse as it requires good knowledge to merge current configuration data with new data coming from new packages.

Config::Model was designed to make user's life easier by providing a configuration GUI and handle configuration upgrades transparently.</abstract>
    <description>This presentation will explain how to provide these capabilities and will cover:
* the main notions or Config::Model (config tree and model)
* how to create a model 
* how to interface the model with the configuration files
* how package and configuration upgrade is performed 
* how to specify upgrade feature in the configuration model</description>

    <language>English</language>
    <abstract>Fedora, Mandriva and openSUSE are the three largest distributions that use RPM as their package manager. Unfortunately, because of the non-coordinated decisions taken in the past, the packaging in these distributions has taken a slightly different form.</abstract>
    <description>As the result, the packages are not easily interchangeable among these distributions. We tried to identify the differences, the most obvious problems and to propose solutions how to improve this situation. Some of them can be achieved by changing the packaging guidelines and making them more consistent with the rest, the others need modifications in the RPM source code and implementation of its new features. The talk tries to summarize our ongoing efforts in bringing the packaging closer, describe what already has been done and what still needs to be worked on.</description>

    <abstract>The OpenSuSE KIWI Image System provides a complete operating system image solution for Linux supported hardware platforms as well as for virtualisation systems like Xen, Qemu or VMware.</abstract>
    <description>The KIWI architecture was designed as a two level system. The first stage, based on a valid software package source, creates a so called physical extend according to the provided image description. The second stage creates from a required physical extend an operating system image. The result of the second stage is called a logical extend or short an image. 

There are already a lot of projects using the KIWI image system today including the very popular SUSE Studio online appliance builder.

This talk briefly introduces the KIWI image system and shows how to create images based on distributions other than openSUSE.</description>

    <title>Dracut - a generic, modular initramfs generation tool</title>
    <subtitle/>
    <track>Distributions</track>
    <type>Podium</type>
    <language>English</language>
    <abstract>Dracut is a generic, modular initramfs generation tool, that replaces mkinitrd and nash. Unlike existing initramfs’s, this is an attempt at having as little as possible hard-coded into the initramfs as possible.</abstract>
    <description>The initramfs has (basically) one purpose in life — getting the rootfs mounted so that we can transition to the real rootfs. This is all driven off of device availability. 

Therefore, instead of scripts hard-coded to do various things, we depend on udev to create device nodes for us and then when we have the rootfs’s device node, we mount and carry on. Dracut is modular and very easy to extend and customize.

In this talk you will learn how Dracut works, how to extend Dracut with your own modules and identify problems in this early boot process.</description>

    <title>Transactional Roll-backs and Upgrades</title>
    <subtitle/>
    <track>Distributions</track>
    <type>Podium</type>
    <language>English</language>
    <abstract>As part of the MANCOOSI project, looking to improve upon the upgrade process of packages, Caixa Mágica and several other European partners are researching and developing solutions for various, related topics of the package upgrade process. One aspect is that of looking at whether Roll-Back is feasible and what mechanisms are best for making this sort of approach work alongside existing package meta-installers.</abstract>
    <description>We will state what we define as Roll-Back and the associated problems of trying to achieve this process. To do this we investigate current state-of-the-art mechanisms available for 'Roll-Back' and configuration management and then state what our current methodology is for trying to tackle and achieve Roll-Back for our apt-rpm based distribution. We outline some of the decisions and assumptions  that have been taken and indicate what the project members believe the outcome will be. 

We will then invite questions from the audience to try and promote a few talking points.</description>

    <track>Distributions</track>
    <type>Podium</type>
    <language>English</language>
    <abstract>YOURI stands for "Youri Offers an Upload &amp; Repository Infrastucture". It aims to build tools making management of a coherent set of packages easier.</abstract>
    <description>Running a package distribution project involves a lot of tasks:
* allow individual maintainers to upload packages in a central repository
* create packages index for packages managers such as urpmi or yum
* synchronise developement resources such as CVS or bugzilla
* advertise new packages
* sign packages numerically
* check individual packages consistency
* check global repository consistency
* etc...

The quick'n'dirty approach of using a pile of dedicated shell scripts, with hardcoded distributer-specific policies, generally results quickly in a maintainance nightmare for admins and a discrepancy nightmare for users. YOURI aims to leverage those issues by providing a generic package management framework, focused on code reusability and modularity.</description>

    <title>Cross-distro dependency resolution: reusing solvers among distros</title>
    <subtitle/>
    <track>Distributions</track>
    <type>Podium</type>
    <language>English</language>
    <abstract>All distributions use some kind of meta-data describing relationships between packages such as Dependencies, Conflicts,  Virtual Packages, etc. Existing package managers are often specific to a packaging format, or even use implicit assumptions on the meaning of package relations in the context of a distribution.</abstract>
    <description>This talk addresses the issue of how we can overcome this seclusion by resolving inter-package relations in a way that is independent from a specific distribution.

We will present CUDF (Common Upgradeability Description Format) which permits to encode upgrade scenarios coming from different packaging systems, including in particular .deb-based and .rpm-based distributions. The format comes with a clear semantics which makes it possible to share resolution tools among distributions, and to adapt general-purpose solvers to the needs of FLOSS distributions.

We also show how, in the context of the Mancoosi project, we are using the CUDF format to improve the solving abilities of state-of-the-art package managers in distributions such as Debian, Mandriva, and Caixa Magica.</description>

    <abstract>When Ubuntu was made public in 2004, it was clear from the beginning that its development would be based on Debian. Five years later, this has not changed at all, and the interactions between Debian and Ubuntu have been the subject of a lot of (heated) discussions over the years.</abstract>
    <description>This talk will first present how the two distributions interact with each other. Then, we will provide a (tentative) overview of the current state of affairs, and will try to give some ideas for the future.</description>

    <abstract>The talk will describe current development efforts @rpm5.org to add ACID properties to RPM package management.</abstract>
    <description>All operations involved in installing a package, not only the package metadata, but also the system calls, content, and scripts run by RPM will be logged within a transaction using a two-phase apply -&gt; commit/abort so that all RPM operations can become stateless and invertible.

The talk will specifically focus on and overview of the log management tools and the rpmdb schema changes necessary to use Berkeley DB ACID and transactional log extensions to add ACID properties to RPM package management.

Connections with the parallel Mancoosi WP3 efforts to model/simulate package script behavior using a Domain Specific Language will also be described, time permitting.</description>

    <title>Continuous Packaging with Project-Builder.org</title>
    <subtitle/>
    <track>Distributions</track>
    <type>Podium</type>
    <language>English</language>
    <abstract>With the increasing role of FLOSS in enterprise, some development techniques linked to it also know a momentum. Continuous integration (shared sources repository, automatic build, automatic test) is such an example. The new process called continuous packaging should still be promoted and developed as best practice for industry.

Project-Builder.org is a new GPL v2 tool designed to help projects developers producing easily packages for multiple OS and architectures, on a regular basis, from a single source repository.</abstract>
    <description>90% of users and admins prefer to install packages rather than tar files or content from a [D]VCS. But packages don't necessarily follow the development stream of projects, to package alpha, beta. Giving the possibility for projects to distribute seamlessly packages for whatever step of their development is clearly a gain for the whole community.

The various aspects covered by the tool are:
* only produce software packages (ease integration in deployment severs, provide inheritance mecanisms, and Virtual Machines (VM) or Environments (VE))
* ease the various steps of solution life cycle (controlled ipact of installation/uninstallation, dependencies management, identical deliveries up to the customer, announce management, web site delivery, metadata management)
* help new projects in the provisioning of packages (templates and skeletons for the various supported OS, generated structure, help in VM/VE build)
* Avoid code or metadata duplication, as well as has no impact on the original project (macro system, separate repository)
* Neutral in term of Unix environment (repository, system, package type  agnostic)

These features help reducing the development cost by providing a process, method and tools to realize continuous packaging during the whole project life cycle.
Today the tool supports:
* Multiple repository (none - aka tar balls, SVN, CVS, Git, Mercurial, SVK...)
* Multiple systems ((RPM Linux - Red Hat, openSUSE, Mandriva, ..., deb Linux - Debian, Ubuntu, ..., ebuild - Gentoo, pkg Solaris/OpenSolaris, ...)
* Multiple build environments (local, VM - QEMU, KVM, ..., VE - mock, rinse, pbuilder, ...)
* Multiple repository manager (yum, urpmi, apt, ...)
and this at various phasis (development, test, integration, delivery)

It aims at becoming a tools for the vcs-pkg.org initiative
It's today used for projects as diverse as FOSSology, MondoRescue, LinuxCOE, GOsa², itself, ...

The presentation will describe the needs of the various people around a FLOSS project (user, admin, developer, packager), how packaging is a must have in the project, why package early, package often is the right mantra, and how Project-Builder.org can help them all achieve those goals.</description>

    <abstract>Coherence - The Digital Livingroom and beyond (sharing our media with UPnP/DLNA).</abstract>
    <description>After quite some time, where our digital media was limited to dedicated devices - e.g. mp3 players - or spend an isolated life on the PCs of their owners, more and more consumer device appear on the market allowing to easily share these media files in an household (and beyond).

The protocols behind UPnP A/V and DLNA are nowadays implemented in nearly every connected Consumer Electronics device. Being it some first simple clients years ago, continuing with consoles like the PS3 and the XBox 360, media clients like the !PopcornHour,... and now they can be found in amplifiers, TVs and even mobile phones from various vendors.

Using these UPnP A/V and DLNA on our computers and enabling our favourite applications to enter that world, creates a unique landscape where suddenly bridges appear between formerly isolated digital islands.

Coherence is a framework written in Python, that greatly simlifies the entry into the UPnP world. It provides numerous UPnP devices, that can instantly used to serve media-files, act as a gateway to online resources, or to expose the media-db of some application. Others enable controllable media playback for instance via GStreamer.</description>

    <abstract>PackageKit one year on: what's changed, and where are we heading</abstract>
    <description>PackageKit is now an established project with a team of developers, and stable front-ends to KDE and GNOME. In this presentation I'll explain what progress we've made in the last year, and what direction the projects are heading. This talk will focus on how application authors can leverage PackageKit, and what PackageKit is now allowing applications to do. We will talk about unresolved issues such as application installation, config file handling (during the transaction) and dealing with complex package management tasks in an abstract daemon.

There will be time left for questions and discussion. It is expected the audience will be technically skilled, and possess a comprehensive understanding of package management.</description>

    <title>The evolution of MonoTorrent</title>
    <subtitle/>
    <track>Mono</track>
    <type>Podium</type>
    <language>English</language>
    <abstract>MonoTorrent is an implementation of the BitTorrent protocol written in C# for the .NET platform.</abstract>
    <description>This talk will have two parts. The first part will revolve around the Piece Picking algorithm and how it evolved from a simplistic and inextensible initital implementation to its current highly extensible form as more complex behaviours were required.

The second part will be about the different strategies used to manage the multi-threaded workload. A typical bittorrent download will open about 100 connections so it is critical that the syncronisation strategy used to access any shared state does not prevent the sockets from sending/receiving data, otherwise performance will suffer.</description>

    <title>ParallelFx, bringing Mono applications in the multicore era</title>
    <subtitle/>
    <track>Mono</track>
    <type>Podium</type>
    <language>English</language>
    <abstract>Multicore computer are now part of our everyday life. Most desktop and laptop machines out there bundle a dual-core processor, quad-core processor or even 8-core processor by default. This multiplication of the number of core on the same chip is destined to become the way for manufacturers to remain competitive. However, developers were a bit left out in this process, having written sequential programs for ages whereas they were now required to parallelize their program to make them efficient which isn't an easy step to take.</abstract>
    <description>That's why we now see the apparition of framework designed to help programmers to take advantage of this new architecture of processor by hiding away the parallel difficulty under primitives that they are used to. ParallelFx is one of such framework for the Mono and .NET world. By providing several new parallel constructs and concurrent data structures, it allows Mono applications to enter painlessly in this new multicore era.

This talk will cover several points :
* What options Mono provide to speed up applications today
* A bit of background on the framework
* The components ParallelFx provides
* Some how-to and usage of the framework
* Status of ParallelFx in Mono</description>

It sketches general requirements for real-time applications, basic RTEMS features, the structural differences between a Linux based and an RTEMS based application, available APIs, available subsystems and the driver models.

The goal of this session is to emphasis the distinct requirements addressed in RTEMS compared to UNIX-like Operating Systems. This should be a good base for further discussions on collaboration with other projects.</description>

    <title>Network virtualisation using Crossbow technology</title>
    <subtitle/>
    <track>Alt-OS</track>
    <type>Podium</type>
    <language>English</language>
    <abstract>Leveraging current hardware capacities becomes one of the major topics in current IT business. Designing tools for deploying network virtualization and effectively controlling virtual network environments from the perspective of network capacities raised demand for a project called Crossbow.</abstract>
    <description>With this technology we could effectively control how an application access to the network and decide how much bandwidth it could use. Also, we could dynamically allocate bandwidth resources giving to the application surplus if needed on behalf of other(s) application(s) whose network resources are underutilized. This is done by creating Virtual Network Interface Cards (VNICs)and dedicating each of them to the different application we want to deploy. In this presentation we'll show how Crossbow technology work in practice deployed on OpenSolaris.</description>

    <title>Porting challenge: Flashrom, the universal flash tool</title>
    <subtitle/>
    <track>Alt-OS</track>
    <type>Podium</type>
    <language>English</language>
    <abstract>Flashrom is the open source utility of choice to read and write flash chips and a real porting challenge because it needs full hardware access from userspace.</abstract>
    <description>Some say that only X.org needs a similar level of hardware access. Flashrom is working under Linux, *BSD, OpenSolaris, Mac
OS X and Windows (somewhat) and people use it to reflash BIOSes, graphics/network/SATA cards, a game console and to control a boatload of external flash programmers.

This talk gives a short overview of flashrom and its architecture, and then goes into detail about the work needed to port it to your favourite OS.</description>

    <title>Porting KGI graphics drivers from Linux to GNU Hurd</title>
    <subtitle/>
    <track>Alt-OS</track>
    <type>Podium</type>
    <language>English</language>
    <abstract>GGI/KGI is a graphics driver framework, offering a clear seperation between actual hardware access and abstraction. The hardware access part was originally a kernel driver for monolithic UNIX kernels like Linux and FreeBSD. This talk is about porting that framework, to work with the hardware access part running as a userspace server process on top of the multiserver microkernel system GNU Hurd.</abstract>
    <description>After a short introduction to GGI/KGI and Hurd architecture, this talk will dwell a bit on the interesting aspects of porting the kernel driver to run as a userspace process instead.</description>

    <abstract>This talk will give a short presentation of the Device Driver Environment (DDE), a library that helps porting Linux and FreeBSD device drivers to other operating systems.</abstract>
    <description>The DDE is divided into two parts, the DDEkit, a generic operating system abstraction layer, and guest-specific DDE's (currently available for Linux 2.6 and FreeBSD) allowing to run unmodified Linux and FreeBSD device drivers. Currently there exist implementations for TUD:OS, an L4 microkernel based operating system developed at TU Dresden and the Genode operating system framework developed by Genode Labs (Dresden). There are also plans to port the DDE to Minix 3.</description>

    <abstract>Haiku has No Future (like most other small OSS Operating Systems)</abstract>
    <description>Many Open Source projects start as small but ambitious endeavors, with the hopes of becoming successful. Though it is fair to say that most do not. By taking some recent examples of successful OSS projects and putting it in a juxtaposition with contemporary queer theory (after all, being alternative is all about being queer), I attempt to construct a new definition of success that hopefully serves as an inspiration for OSS projects.</description>

    <abstract>Simple Webkit is a reimplementation of major parts of the WebKit Obj-C API (WebView, WebFrame etc.).</abstract>
    <description>Internally it uses pure Obj-C. This keeps requirements towards the compiler low (there isn't Obj-C++ support for all embedded architectures). Another simplification is that it is completely based on the rendering engine of NSAttributedString and NSTextView instead of having its own. This keeps the code and binaries small for a full (X)HTML 4 compatible WebView (approx. 1 MByte). The presentation describes the internal architecture and the status of CSS and JavaScript integration.</description>

    <description>In this presentation, we will take a look at the Étoilé history back to 2004 when the project started, and why we haven't yet released a version aimed at end users.

Over the years we realized more experimentation time was needed to succeed. Which has gradually led the project to take a more radical and slow path. We will explain how and why we changed our priorities and expanded the scope of the project in several directions.

We will also discuss the project status, our current work and what can be expected in 2010.</description>

    <type>Podium</type>
    <language>English</language>
    <abstract>EtoileUI is a high-level UI toolkit for Étoilé where elements visible on screen are abstract nodes to which pluggable aspects can be bound. The same uniform tree structure is used to describe any kind of structured content (composite document, application User Interface etc.) and the role of each node can be entirely changed at runtime by altering the aspects bound to it.

All User Interface concerns such as layouts, tools, action handlers, styles, model objects etc. are pluggable aspects which can be easily reused and recombined.</abstract>
    <description>In this presentation, we will give a general introduction to the EtoileUI framework available on any GNUstep platform and also Mac OS X (EtoileUI is Cocoa compatible).
We will discuss which problems EtoileUI tries to solve, how it integrates with the GNUstep/Cocoa AppKit, and how it moves away from the monolithic widget model used by most other UI toolkits to support treating the User Interface as a permanent prototype. Finally we will show various examples written in Smalltalk and Objective-C to illustrate some key ideas and their benefits:
* Everything can be changed at runtime
* Represents the whole screen as a composite document
* Closer to the mental model we use to describe a User Interface</description>

    <subtitle/>
    <track>GNUstep</track>
    <type>Podium</type>
    <language>English</language>
    <abstract>Objective-C support in the main branch of GCC has faltered somewhat in recent years, with no support for any of the new features in what Apple dubbed 'Objective-C 2.0'.  This lack of support for things like declared properties has, increasingly, made it difficult to port code from OS X to other platforms.</abstract>
    <description>More recently, Apple has focused on clang, a new front end for the LLVM compiler infrastructure, supporting C, Objective-C and C++. This has made supporting new language features much easier.

Objective-C also requires a runtime library to implement the dynamic features.  This talk will discuss the GNUstep runtime (libobjc2), which provides most of the features required for Objective-C 2 and it's support in clang, as well as the plans for the future evolution of the Objective-C support on non-Apple platforms.</description>

    <subtitle/>
    <track>GNUstep</track>
    <type>Podium</type>
    <language>English</language>
    <abstract>The Objective-C runtime library provides a set of functions and data structures used to implement the dynamic behaviour of Objective-C. This is a Smalltalk-like object model, with dynamic message sending and introspection. LanguageKit is part of the Ètoilé project and provides an interpreter, just-in-time, and static compiler back end, using LLVM, for implementing dynamic languages.</abstract>
    <description>This talk will discuss the implementation of LanguageKit and cover some of its current and potential uses. LanguageKit is used to implement Ètoilé's Pragmatic Smalltalk, which generates classes that are ABI-compatible with Objective-C, meaning that Objective-C and Smalltalk classes can subclass or extend each other, with no bridging overhead.  In common cases Smalltalk performance is similar to that of Objective-C.</description>

    <abstract>Étoilé allows (and encourage) programs to be written in Smalltalk instead of Objective-C, as our Smalltalk implementation,
Pragmatic Smalltalk, directly integrates with the Objective-C runtime.

That way, programmers can get the best of both world, mixing Smalltalk and Objective-C freely. But Smalltalk, being a dynamic language by nature, authorize a more powerful development environment, and CodeMonkey wants to implement such an IDE for Étoilé.</abstract>
    <description>CodeMonkey is heavily based on LanguageKit, and people interested by the low-level implementation of Pragmatic Smalltalk are strongly encourage to assist David Chisnall's talk!</description>

    <title>ocpp-2.0: a preprocessor approach to translate Objective-C 2.0 extensions to Objective-C 1.0 for (older) platforms</title>
    <subtitle/>
    <track>GNUstep</track>
    <type>Podium</type>
    <language>English</language>
    <abstract>With the introduction of OS X 10.5 Apple had defined an gcc-extension for Objective-C which brings many interesting features to the language: garbage collection, properties, synchronization, fast enumerations, dot-notation for getters and setters, code blocks, etc.</abstract>
    <description>Although Apple provides their extensions back to gcc, integration is slow because it has to be tested against all other gcc features and also needs special considerations for different target architectures. So let's dicsuss another approach: write a preprocessor that maps the new Obj-C 2.0 features back to any existing Obj-C 1.0 compiler (plus some library calls if needed). This should allow to faster follow new developments of the language. The talk offers for discussion a flex/bison grammar for Obj-C 2.0 and some strategies for translating the new features.</description>

    <abstract>An introduction to the NoSQL scene: the subfamilies, the projects, as well as their advantages &amp; drawbacks compared to each other or traditional SQL systems.</abstract>
    <description>1. 40 years in the desert: yes, the relational model is actually celebrating its [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=362685 40th birthday] this year. Let's take an unbiased look about what’s great and not-so-great about it.

2. A not-so-novel idea: precursors &amp; roots of NoSQL systems from the 70s to the 00s. NoSQL projects are not just defined in opposition to SQL; they come from approaches as old or sometimes older than the relational model itself.

3. The odd couple family: why those very separate projects, efforts and models have been grouped together under one brand in the public’s mind. Plus, a possible categorization of the sub-families within the movement.

4. “What's in a name? That which we call a NoSQL system, by any other name would be as frackin’ sweet”: Obligatory, rapid mention of the controversy around the name and why nobody should care.

5. SQL vs. NoSQL, Live from... THE THUNDERDOME: a breakdown of where NoSQL sub-families tend to shine (and where SQL should probably be used instead.)

6. It's Alive: production examples of NoSQL systems.

7. (If time allows.) The road ahead: future developments, business development possibilities, missing approaches &amp; projects.</description>

    <title>Introduction to MongoDB</title>
    <subtitle/>
    <track>NoSQL</track>
    <type>Podium</type>
    <language>English</language>
    <abstract>MongoDB is a fast, scalable database that was designed for web development.</abstract>
    <description>This talk will cover:
* Scaling with MongoDB (replica pairs, master/slave, sharding)
* Getting started - CRUD and the JavaScript shell
* Creating schemas for a document-oriented DB
* Interesting features for developers (capped collections, file storage, upserts and more)

MongoDB's goals are:
# Be easy to learn and simple to deploy
# Have the scalability BigTable clones but with dynamic queries
# Have the speed of key value stores but with secondary indexes
# Be a floor wax and a dessert topping

Maybe not that last one.

MongoDB is being used by SourceForge, EA Games, Github, the New York Times, and tons of other companies.</description>

    <subtitle/>
    <track>NoSQL</track>
    <type>Podium</type>
    <language>English</language>
    <abstract>OpenStreetMap is a collaborative mapping project inspired by Wikipedia.  The heart of OpenStreetMap is its geo-data.  All geographic elements are described using a simple database structure and free-form tagging.  A road may be described by tagging it as highway=motorway, a hospital by amenity=hospital, a lake by landuse=water, etc.</abstract>
    <description>The main database uses PostgreSQL and is accessed exclusively through a REST based API. It receives continuous updates from a 30,000 strong community of users. Consequently, in order to maintain acceptable performance, queries on the database are restricted to simple rectangular areas of no more than 0.25 square degrees.

The challenge was to mirror this database and provide an API that permitted queries on larger areas and provided extended query capabilities, such as the ability to find hospitals or fire stations or bars.  We chose GT.M because of it's a high performance schema-free database that would handle key/value pairs economically and scale well to accommodate the continuous growth of the data.</description>

    <subtitle/>
    <track>NoSQL</track>
    <type>Podium</type>
    <language>English</language>
    <abstract>Using NoSQL data stores makes you change the way you design and query data, so you have to learn new tools and methods to get the full power of your NoSQL DB. In this session we will focus on how to stop thinking 'SQL and relations' and start thinking 'views and MapReduce' with CouchDB.</abstract>
    <description>Our first challenge will be to query our documents with flexibility to get the data we need. To handle this, we will show how we can translate our good old SQL SELECT queries into Map and/or Reduce functions.

The second challenge of our session will be to design a model both able to deal with the absence of relations between data and easy to query against. After describing basic but not totally satisfying solutions to this problem, we will delve into a more CouchDB-compliant way.</description>

    <type>Podium</type>
    <language>English</language>
    <abstract>There is more to the MySQL server than MySQL 5.1 GA. There are a lot of patches available that are not included in the official MySQL source tree. There are several new or enhanced storage engines.</abstract>
    <description>There are a handful of branches of the MySQL source code maintained by community members. And there are official MySQL milestone releases and snapshots. But to benefit from all of this, one has to know that they exist, and know how to use them.

In my talk, I will first give an overview of what community enhancements of various kinds are available. I will then go through the options for using these enhancements, including using pre-build binaries from various sources, building from alternative source trees, building storage engine plugins, and patching upstream MySQL sources.</description>

    <language>English</language>
    <abstract>Taking a client from a 700ms (at times 1-2 seconds) page load time to a consistent 60ms is a great success story for improvement in database performance. In this presentation we will outline the steps taken and what can be applied to any website as one model to use in evaluation of your website.</abstract>
    <description>While part of a longer talk, we will be reviewing the highlights including:
* Identify what is truly slow and high volume queries
* Choosing the right indexes including unique indexes, concatenated and partical indexes
* Choosing the right storage engines (MyISAM, InnoDB and Memory)
* Removing load including synchronous/real-time queries, master load, locking and sharding
* The best performance improvement for a SQL statement is to eliminate it
* Quantifying improvements made 

The 10 Points are:
# Monitor, Monitor, Monitor
# Identify problem SQL
# Analyze problem SQL
# Indexes
# Offloading master load
# Improving SQL
# Storage engines
# Caching
# Sharding
# Handling database maintenance 

Bonus: Front end improvements</description>

    <track>MySQL</track>
    <type>Podium</type>
    <language>English</language>
    <abstract>Replication with MySQL is very easy to set up but also very easy to break. As soon as inconsistencies are introduced, the master and the slaves start being desynchronized - and most often, you have no way to be quickly and efficiently aware of the problem as MySQL offers no built-in mechanism to check data consistency between servers.</abstract>
    <description>Fortunately Maatkit has a neat solution with 2 nice scripts: mk-table-checksum, which is a tool to detect inconsistencies between a master and its slaves and mk-table-sync, which can correct automatically these problems detected with mk-table-checksum.

This session will show you first how to use both tools depending on your replication setup (master-slaves or master-master) and then how to get the most from the multiple options that are available.</description>

    <abstract>Android on Freerunner: Past, present and future of porting Android on the Openmoko Freerunner GTA02</abstract>
    <description>The Android on Freerunner project aims at porting Android to the Openmoko Freerunner GTA02. The current working release is based on the work done by Koolu for Android Cupcake and includes patches by the community.

In this talk, the project background is explained. A few words are dedicated to the Openmoko Freerunner and why it's considered as a true open phone. We will present the overview of the current functionalities of Android on the Freerunner.

Looking at the roadmap, we cast some light on the short term and longer term objectives.

This will a great opportunity to meet the people behind the project and see Android on the Freerunner in action.</description>

    <type>Podium</type>
    <language>English</language>
    <abstract>The GPU is one of the most complex piece of hardware in modern computer. With kernel modesetting, more part of the driver move from userspace to the kernel allowing a cleaner support for suspend/resume and others GPU specific handling. The complexity of OpenGL driver, and also driver for new API such as OpenCL, are in userspace and will more than likely stay 
there.</abstract>
    <description>This presentation will look at the unique problem of GPU kernel API to userspace. How userspace can interface with the kernel to submit GPU command in an as efficient as possible way. A brief review of what have been done and what is done now for various GPU, and insight on what might be better solution in the future will be given. Last part of the presentation will devolve to the status of radeon kernel modesetting which is now the largest driver inside the linux kernel with more the 70 000 lines of code and supporting more than 7 different GPU families.</description>

    <title>Simplify web application development with JWt</title>
    <subtitle/>
    <track>Free Java</track>
    <type>Podium</type>
    <language>English</language>
    <abstract>JWt is a relatively new Java library for developing interactive web applications that may be deployed within standard Java Servlet containers. JWt 3.1 is a feature-complete pure Java sibling of Wt 3.1, the well known C++ web toolkit which has been around for years.</abstract>
    <description>This talk will introduce the audience to the basic JWt concepts. You will learn how JWt handles events, how JWt applications are deployed, and why applications written in JWt will be faster and cause less server load than many other frameworks.

Unlike many page-based frameworks, JWt was designed for creating stateful applications that are at the same time highly interactive (leveraging techniques such as AJAX to their fullest) and accessible (supporting plain HTML browsers), using automatic graceful degradation or progressive enhancement.

Come to this talk if you have an interest in doing web application development and prefer a pragmatic approach to developing web user interfaces very much like you have developed desktop user interface (e.g. in Swing).</description>

    <title>The ARM Optimised Interpreter and Thumb2 JIT</title>
    <subtitle/>
    <track>Free Java</track>
    <type>Podium</type>
    <language>English</language>
    <abstract>The ARM architecture in constrained devices such as smartphones and low end netbooks presents unique challenges for the VM writer. The ARM Optimised Interpreter delivers performance improvement of up to five times the C interpreter in the OpenJDK Zero port while maintaining smooth performance throughout. This talk looks at the techniques used and explores how they could be extended to other architectures.

The second part of the talk will look inside the Thumb2 JIT. The principle design goal of the Thumb2 JIT was to optimise time of first execution rather than peak performance. As such the design goals were to produce a JIT giving very fast compile time while generating reasonable and compact code.</abstract>
    <description>The ARM architecture is typically used in constrained devices such as smartphones and low end netbooks. Typically a constrained device has
* Single, not multiple core
* Relatively fast core speed (800MHz)
* Small primary cache (32K I+D)
* Small secondary cache
* Slow memory system (typically 300nS)
* Small memory system (typically 512M)

This means that the system is almost completely constrained by the memory system. A single cache miss can cost up to 270 cycles.

This presents particular challenges for the VM writer. A traditional JIT solution may not offer the best performance because of cache trashing. For larger applications the interpreter may actually offer better performance than a JIT.

Over the past year I have been working on a project to improve the Java performance on these devices. I have implemented this by writing an optimised ARM Interpreter in hand crafted ARM assembler and coupling this with a Thumb2 JIT which interacts quickly and seamlessly with the interpreter.</description>

    <abstract>FreeBSD aims to provide a high-quality modern operating system, however adding new features inevitably introduces bugs. Although several kernel debugging tools have been added and evolved in the last years, the quality of the kernel problem reports show that only a few FreeBSD users know how (or are willing) to take advantage of them.</abstract>
    <description>This talk will present the tools most commonly used when investigating problems in the kernel, some techniques to extact useful information, and the most commonly made mistakes to look for when inspecting the code. I will also give a few practical tips and examples on how not to turn kernel debugging into a frustrating experience.</description>

    <language>English</language>
    <abstract>The conversion of the main FreeBSD source repository to Subversion has opened the possibility of tracking one or more FreeBSD branches closely and with a fine-grained changeset based approach.</abstract>
    <description>This talk is about one of the ways the distributed Mercurial SCM can be used to periodically pull sets of changesets from the main FreeBSD svn repository and import them as atomic commits to a local branch.

Then we will describe two different ways to use the local branch as a basis for FreeBSD customizations: how to keep a stack of patches as a linear 'customization layer' on top of FreeBSD, and how to keep another local branch with its own merge history.</description>
